    You can check how I built the database in this notebook,

    by hand, i.e. I sat down and typed Album - Artist (Year) so there are typos
    and inconsistencies.

    Moreover, I got most of the data with the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)
    via the [musicbrainzngs](https://python-musicbrainzngs.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/)
    library and some other info with the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers).
    Both depend on manual contributions
    by users, so data on each artist and album is not always complete or accurate.
