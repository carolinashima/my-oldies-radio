# My oldies radio ðŸ“»

Lately I have been reflecting on my music listening habits.
The ease and availability of streaming services allowed me to discover and listen to more music than ever, as evidenced by my [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/caro_g),
but at the same time I have felt that I don't connect to music as I used to. Moving abroad in 2015 also meant that my usual MO of
discovering/listening/storing my music library changed drastically (i.e. I stopped collecting) and not having access to my library surely made me forget about
bands, albums, and songs I had once been obsessed with.

The goal of this little project is to help me revisit and rediscover old favourites and reminisce about past times.

There are two parts/scripts here: in the notebook I turn my old-school .txt list of music into a database.
The Streamlit app is for me to interact with the database more easily.
