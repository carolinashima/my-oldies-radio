    "# Database creation\n",
    "Since I started collecting music I was concerned about finding the stuff I had. In the beginning my memory was enough, but as albums, singles & EPs, bootlegs, and compilations started piling up, I had to look for a way to keep track of what I had and where it was. I started a plain .txt file with Artist - Album (year) - Storage as an easy way to search for things I wanted to listen to, and this file gradually grew over the years until I stopped regularly downlading music and started relying more on streaming services around mid-2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I tried to create a database that was easier to query with the goal of finding and rediscovering \"old\" music in my library. Having built that .txt by hand means there's probably a lot of typos and other inconsistencies so it will not be a perfect solution, but it's good enough for my purpose: to revisit old favourites."
